# Wear OS AlarmManager
A new platform called Wear OS was created especially for wearable technology. Despite being focused on Android, it has a distinctive appearance and a range of special features. Users can build a list of things with a reminder time assigned to each task using the alarm manager on Wear OS application.
It aids in keeping track of one's critical responsibilities.
Also, it is helpful for starting and carrying out additional activities when used with broadcast receivers.
Besides, it lessens one's reliance on timers or background processes that run all the time. 

Access to the Android AlarmManager, which functions quite differently from iOS Local Notifications, is made available via this module.
